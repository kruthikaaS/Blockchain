UNDERSTANDING BITCOIN FUNCTIONS:
--------------------------------

- major use of blockchain happens in bitcoins, a type of cryptocurrency.
- Anyone using bitcoin can have one of the 2 roles or even both in some cases.

1) Bitcoin user:

 	- uses his local money or fiat money to purchase bitcoins for bitcoin transactions.
	- Bitcoins can be purchased using services like Kraken and COinbase in exhnage for fiat currencies.
	- value of bitcoin is determined by the market price at the time of purchase.
	- the exchange rate is how much btcs will we get for a dollar.
	- after buying btc we can either store it in our wallet on our PC or smartphone or register with a vendor.
	-


2) Bitcoin Miner:
        - their role is to give "PROOF OF WORK" which will enable a new block to be added to blockchian.
        - they are rewarded with new bitcoins for the "PROOF OF WORK" they do.
        - A miner can either exchange their coins for a fiat currency or use btc for further transactions
        - mining is a expensive process which requires lots of computing processors. hence not all can beocome miners.


MECHANISM OF BITCOIN FUNCTION:
-------------------------------
- sender and recipient must be a part of the bitcoin blockchian.
- ecah receiver has a unqiue address which is the hash of the public key of the receiver.
- the sender must specify the address of the recipient while initaiting the transaction.

ex: ALice wants to send 10 btc to bob using her bitcoin wallet. she initiates the trasnaction by specifyimng bob's 
adress as the destination and along with it pays a negligble processing fee. this transcation is distributed to all
the computers in the blockchain network and is queued up to be processed which can take upto 10 mins.

AT the end of 10 mins 2 blocks gets added to the blockchain ledger, one saying alice has 10 btc less and 2nd saying
bob has 10 btc more. But the additions of these 2 block only happend when 2 conditions are met.



Condition 1: a consesnus must be obtained from all the computers in the btc blockchain that th transation is 
               legit
  

Condition 2: Miner in the netwrok successfully resolves a specific hash output based on a specific input. the 
               specific hash output is what we call "PROOF OF WORK". Since this process takes upto 10 mins to 
               be completed, no block in the meantime will be accepted as authentic and added to blockchain till 
               a winning hash emerges.This also helps to prevent people from making the same transaction twice or
               more time during the processing window.

FEATURE OF BLOCKS IN A BLOCKCHAIN:
-----------------------------------

- all the blocks are interlinked.
- ANy new block added to the block chian is dependent on the previous one 
- the address of the new block is the hash of the previous block.
- so any tampering to the blocks will result in change of the hash of the tampered block there by making the 
  subsequent block screen fowl and invalid.
