USES OF BLOCK CHAIN IN VARIOUS SECTORS:
---------------------------------------

FINANCIAL SECTORS:
-------------------
blockchain technology can 

-Top benifit of this technlogy is "EFFICIENCY"
-create new financial products, servies, job categories and skills
-can reduce fraud and risk
-offer high quality consumer experience.
-create low barrier entry to allow people from developing countries to participate in financial markets both as 
 consumers and producers.
-can amplify and extend the benifits of seamless e-payment and recipt system which are already enabling e-commerce
 in underdeveloped rural parts of the world like WeChat in China, Zoto in Nigeria and YellowPepper in Latin America.
-helps to reduce intermediateries.
-establish a trustless connections between entities
-Secure and immutable record of all transactions. 

SOME EXAMPLES OF REAL LIFE COMPANIES USING BLOCKCHIAN TECHNOLOGY:
------------------------------------------------------------------
1) FACTOM ==> Austin based mortgage industry uses a product called Factom Harmony to ensure mortgage clients and 
              companies have complied with regualations, document are preserved securely and easily availabe at the
              time of audit.

2) Bank of China==> uses block chain technology for property valuation system for home loans.

3) NASDAQ LINQ ===> enables an issuer to digitally reprsent a record of ownership, reduce settlemet time and eliminates
                    the need for paper stock certifcates.

ENERGY SECTOR:
--------------
- THere are a wide range of participants in any energy interactions like the generator, distributor, traders, regulators
and end users (factories and homes). 
- this is an extensive ecosystem that is based on trust and has a lot of intermediataties.
- Some possible uses of Blockchain in traditional energy sector: 

1) Verification of renewable electricity and emission allowance
2) A register that records and regulates the owwnership and state of assests such as smart meters, networks, generation facilities.
3) Sharing smart meter data with a wide range of consumers without compromising privacy or security and also offer opportunity to generate income from sharing.


Blockchains for energy billing for EVs (Electronic vehicles)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- blockchain technology can provide an efficinet billing mechanism.
- Slock.it solutions enables secure, efficient blkchian transactions between devices without the need for intermediateries.
- SHARE&CHARGE ==> a startup that allows anyone owining an EV charger to become a provider using blockchain technlogy.



BLOCKCHAIN FOR ALTERNATIVE ENEREGIES:
------------------------------------
- traditional model for energy provison from generaor to consumer using distributors can go in for a toss when communities of people or industries start
  creating their own power using renewable resources like solar energy etc.

- Lets assume a situation where 2 communities exist in a place and due to microclimates one side is mostly sunny and other side is mostly cloudy.Now the sunny
  side produces more than needed energy and this extra energy could be sold to the cloudy side. Blockchain technology can help facilaite this process by using
  smart contacts that manages energy trades. overtime homeowners would accumulate cryptocurrenecies which they can use to exchange for dollars or buy some d
  digital products.

Companies like GRID SINGULARITY, POWER LEDGER, ELECTRON in UK are examples of blockchain based platforms for energy trade.

SOLARCOINS:
-----------
- cryoptos which can be earned by homeowners who are generating solar electricity.
- these are tradable crytops currently available in market.
- this was develeoped to incentivize solar power usage.
- Authentiacting the generation of power results in the collection of solarcoins.


==============================================================================================================================================================

IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND BLOCKCHAINS:
------------------------------------
- Fool proof methods of prooving ones idenitity has been an elusive goal despite the many new methods for authenticating ones identity like
  a) Passports and Identity cards issued by governmnets.
  b) Banking systems requiring new users to regster their PPI(Presonal information)
  c) Debit and credit cards having microchips embedded in them.
Hence use of Blockchains could offer an immutable digital record of the perosn to help manage this situation.

EX 1: uPORT
-------------
City of ZUG, Switzerland has become the first one city in the world that offers its citizen a digital passport to be used for a varierty of applications
in the city. Instead of using the traditional approcah of looking up PPI against a cnetral lib of data, the identities are stored in a blockchain.they use
an app called uPort which is developed on Ethereum blockchain. this app has 4 features:

   i) mobile application ==> a mobile key identity
   ii)opensource developer identities ==> to enable integration of uPort app with other DAPPS or traditional didgit service providers.
   iii)Smart contract ==> codes that run on blockchain  which includes features like access control, account recovery and storage of contacts.
   iv) Developer Tools ===> technical and educational resourses for easily integrating uPort platform to other apps.

Ex 2: CIVIC
------------
- app that uses decentralized architecture along with blockchain technology and biometrics on mobile device to prove identity.
- user downloads the app on smartphone and scans the required document lets say a drivers liscenece for the bussiness.
- the data from the drivers liscence is hashed and an immutable entrty is made in the blockchain.
- the personal information from the card is automatically deleted from CIVIC's serever and users smartphone.

Ex 3: BLOCK AUTH ===> enable usesrs to own and use their own idenitity registers.
ex 4: BITNATION ==> blockchain based solution for identities that include passport and marriage certificate.\
Ex 5: IDENTIFI ===> global address book of trusted and secure entities.
