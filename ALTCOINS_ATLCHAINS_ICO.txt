FEATURES OF ALTCHAINS:
---------------------

- tuned for particular uses. Ex: liquid, a sidechain to the btc blockchain that facilitate rapid transfers of btc
  amongst a small group of people.
- Exercise greater control over btc transactions.ex: require proof that the wallet is owned by a verified institution
  before allowing transactions.

 the leakage of trade secrets.

2) different proof of work or consesnus mechanism
3) can have specific features or focus areas
4) Used for Initial coin offering (ICO) 


===================================================================================================================
INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO):

-its a fundraising mechanism in which startup companies can sell their underlying cryotocurrencies in exchange for
 bitcoins.
- similar to IPO (Inital public offerings) made by companies to encourage people to buy company shares.
- Restricions in place on who can buy ICO coz of 2 risks involved in this. 
     a) since the startup takes money from a global audience of investors, the money raised can be very large.
     b) also they are raising mone pre product which is a huge risk.
