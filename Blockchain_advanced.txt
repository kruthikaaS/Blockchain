Block chian is a special type of distributed database:

 1) instead of resding on a single serever in a datacentre, this database
    is availble in the local machine of all users who use this database.

 2) In order to create a new entry in this database, all partcipanting computers must 
    agree to the change or in other words a consensus must be reached

====================================================================================================================
CRYPTOGRAPHY:
- means secret writing.
- way to send messages between 2 people which ensures no one else other than those 2 people can read the message.

Mechanism of Cryptography: 
---------------------------
Sender writes a message ===> messsage gets encrypted to be shared over a network to the reciever ====> this encrypted
message is decrypted on the receiver's machine and the original message is seen by the receiver.

-Block chain database uses PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) - a type of crytography mechanism.

PKI
---
- involves the use of public and private keys
- public key is visible to all the nodes in the database network. ex: the address of your locked physical mailbox
- private key is visible only to the owner and it remains a secret. ex: the key to open your physical mailbox
- private key is stored in a place called walet in our smartphone or computers.

MECHANSIM INVOLVED IN PKI:
---------------------------
STEP 1: -Generate a private key (usually a combination of alphabets from a-f with some numbers)
        -Generation of private keys automatically creates a public key. However the vice versa is never possible.

STEP 2 : Share your private key to the person who wants to send you some secrets.

STEP 3: The person who receives the public key will lock his/her message using the public key we sent and send you
        the message.  

STEP 4: You will open the message uisng your secret private key.

HOW DOES PKI ENABLE PROOF OF AUTHENTICITY?
------------------------------------------
- By using a digital signature.
- digital signatures use private and public keys to function.
- messages to be sent are signed with our public key
- the receiver has our public key and once he gets our message, the public key will verify and 
  authenticate the signature created by our private key.

This way the proof of authenticity of the sender is acheived.
  

===================================================================================================================
NONCE:
 - its a number that is used just once.
 - it is used for a specific purpose and never used again.
 - one such use is in digital transmission to reduce duplicate transactions. In real life data that is entered into 
   a database can have same identifiers. Adding a nonce to the identifier makes the data additionaly unique thus preventing
   accidental duplication.

HASH FUNCTION:
 - it is a mathematical funation that takes in data of any size and returns a hash(fixed size data).
 - the size of a hash is always same be it a single line of data or a paragraph of data.
 - This process of conveting a text or string to a signature of hash is called hashing.
 - hashing is unideirectional.
 - storing hashes in DB reduces the size of DBs
 - hash has a combination of 64 aplhabets and numbers thus making it an almost unique identifier for a digital product.
 - block chain uses a hashing algorith called SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)

MINING:
WHO ARE MINERS IN A BLOCKCHAIN?
----------------------------------
They are participants in a blockchain network who contribute processing powers to the network to solve mathematical
problems in exchnage for rewards.

 - basically using the nonce and Hashing function to create a complex math problem for a computer to solve. 
 - the computer which solves the assigned mathematical problem will get a reward.

Ex: let us take the string "hello world". Now when we send in this string to the SHA-256 hashing mechanism, we want
    the resulting hash to start with a specific set of numbers say "0000". So we will introduce a NONCE number while
    creating the hash. when this Nonce number is added we will get a different hash output for the same string. A 
    miner or a mining computer will keep on generating adding different NONCE numbers to hashing process till the 
    hash begining with "0000" is obtained. The computer which solves this 1st gets a reward. in order to do this the
    particiating computer needs to spend some of its processing power.

- This method of mining and creating a winning hash provides another important feature of 
  BlockChain technology =========> PROOF OF WORK.

===================================================================================================================

DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY (DLT):

In a blockchain technology, data is stored as blocks and does not reside on a single central authority but a copy of
the database exists in all the participating computers. Thus the database gets the name distributed ledger system.

When a new user joins the network, a copy of the database is 1st downloaded to his computer.As any transaction takes
place, it is recorded in the database of all partcipating computers.

Unlike traditional databse, in a blockchain database for any transaction to be processed and insterted into the 
blockchain ledger, a concensus must be obtained from all the partrcipating computers. 

In addition to this feature, the miners in a block chain technology must create a new hash of a specific combination
called "Proof of work" in oreder to append a new block to the database thus uplholding blockchain DBs integrity.

finally Blockchain distributed ledger is IMMUTABLE meaning it is practiaclly not possible to delete or modify a 
block which has been added. If a mistake is made, its permanent.
