BLOCK CHAINS Basics:
----------------------
What is Blockchain?

   - it is a digital ledger mechanism to authorise, validate and store transactions on a computer network.
   - it is a technology that introduced the notion of trasactional trust through computer code.
   - It was developed to correct the double spend problem while creating bitcoin.

Double spend (making unlimited copies of a digital item which can make cryptocurrency non viable as money)

PROBLEMS SOLVED BY BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY:

Traditional databases have the folllowing 2 problems:

1) Reliability on central database --> Most conventional database have a central authority(owner of the database)
                                who can control what data can be stored, edited or deleted from a database. 
                                If a hacker gets hand of this peron's user id and passowrd, he can potentially 
                                harm the data in the database leading to single point of failure.
 


2) central authority holds all the power --> since central authority holds all the power, we will need a dedicated 
                                             personnel with special skills. we will also require complex approval 
                                             workflows which has lots of human checks and balances. Due to this the
                                             systems can sometimes be prone to errors and there is certainly a delay
                                             in the process. This is also costly and are prone to hacking.

So BLOCKCHAN technolgy helps to solve these 2 problems by distributing the authority over decisions across partcipants
resulting in elemination of the risk and challenges of a central authority.



TYPES OF BLOCKCHAINS:

  1) Permissionless and public blockchain==> these are opensource blockchain where anyone can join without need 
                                             for approval process.

  2) Permissioned and private Blockchain ==> Require approval for participation and access levels and roles are controlled.
                                             mostly used within and between private enterprised that store sensitive
                                             informations.

DAO (DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION) :

Basically an organization where there are no hierarchy of people 
like managers, subordinates n all... everyone is equal and has the right to voice out their opinion, submit ideas
for innovation etc.

Many DAOs exist in financial sectors. Example:Bitcoin network

All financial transaction and rules are recorded in blockchain system which eliminates the need for any financial
Intermediaries.(financial intermediaries ==> institution or person who act as middle man to facilitate any
financial transaction)

ETHEREUM:

- Apart from developing its own set of cryptos(ETHER), this company offers blockchain as a developmental paltform.
- It offers a full fledged decentralized programmable environment.
-
 

SMART CONTRACT:

- its a term used to describe a code that runs on a blockchain. 
- They are a series of function that exexute when certain conditions are met.
- unlike the traditinoal contracts, the execution does not rely on the discretions(to decide what needs to be done
  in creatin situations)of humans.
- these smart contracts run predictably and accurately.

ex: Automatic confirmation of payments for goods once delivered and updation of stock inventory in a supply chain 
    business

USES OF SMART CONTRACT IN BUYING AND SELLING OF DIGITAL ASSETS:

-Block chain technology manages the authenticty and ownership of digital goods like art and photos using NFT.
 
- NON FUNGIBLE TOKENS (NFT)===>are a type of crypto tokens that store details such as owner and description 
of the digital asset on a block chain. when the owner of the NFT decides to sell his digital asset, this NFT will
be trabnsfered to a buyer using smart contract. the tras]nsaction will certify the new owner, transfer any money dues
and conclude the sale without any loose ends.



DeFi(DECENTRALIZED FINANCE):

- new financial service resulted as an outcome of using PROGRAMMABLE BLOCKCHAINS AND SMART CONTRACT 
- requires only an internet connection as contrast to the conventional financial system (Traditional Banks)
  which have a lot of requirements and are not readily available to everyone.
- They are global and are open 24/7.
- there is no central authority to block use, deny services or require pre qualified individuals.
- Transations are fast and error free

BENIFITS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY:
----------------------------------

- Provenance
- Immutability
- Security
- Compliance
- Smart contracts.

VENDORS PROVIDING PRIVATE BLOCKCHAINS: Hyperledger fabric and IBM Blockchain

BaaS (BLOCKCHAIN AS A SERVICE):
-------------------------------
- Microsoft and Kaleido are offering BaaS 
- BaaS uses cloud based architecture to develop blockchain solutions quickly.
- it also keeps maintenance low and provide easier access to the state of art blockchain functions.
